**Liquefy** is an enterprise-grade compression and observability engine designed for high-velocity telemetry. This repository contains the public SDK and the standardized interface for offline data recovery.

## 🛠️ $NULL Sovereign SDK

The **$NULL Sovereign SDK** is the official tool for offline data recovery and verification. It provides a hardened execution environment for the restoration of production `.null` archives.

**This repository + Docker is sufficient for offline decompression and verification. No license is required for decode-only recovery.**

### One-Command Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parad0x-Labs/liquefy.git
cd liquefy
chmod +x ./liquefy
```

### Usage (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Decompress a production archive
./liquefy decompress archive.null restored.log

# Verify bit-perfect integrity
./liquefy verify archive.null
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\liquefy decompress archive.null restored.log
```

## 📂 Offline Decompression (Public, Decode-Only)

Liquefy guarantees that **data is never hostage**. Anyone can decompress production archives locally using the public decode-only appliance.

The `./liquefy` wrapper automatically pulls and runs a **pinned decoder machine** published by Parad0x Labs.

**Notes:**
- **Capabilities:** This public decoder supports **decompression + verification only**.
- **Security:** Runs fully offline (`--network=none`) with a read-only root filesystem.
- **Sealed:** Compression, orchestration, and engine tuning remain proprietary and are not shipped in public repos.
- **Network Note:** If you cannot pull the public decoder image, your environment may be blocking Docker registry access.

## 🛡️ Execution & Maintenance Policy

The $NULL Sovereign SDK is built for **enterprise-grade reliability**. To ensure secure conduction and data sovereignty, the following policies are enforced:

1.  **Maintenance & Compatibility:** This build is optimized for archives generated by v3.1 cores. While decompression is never paywalled, newer archive formats may require the latest signed build of the SDK.
2.  **Execution Safety:** To prevent runtime instability, the appliance requires a standard execution environment. If unauthorized runtime hooks (e.g. `LD_PRELOAD`) are detected, the appliance fails closed.
3.  **Data Sovereignty:** All operations happen locally. No data is ever transmitted back to Parad0x Labs.

## 🏢 Enterprise Engine (Optional)

For higher performance, advanced features (such as **Search-Gate** at scale), and deployment guarantees, Parad0x Labs provides a licensed enterprise appliance.
